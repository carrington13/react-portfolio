### Description
    My, Casey Arrington's, personal portfolio designed to showcase my personality, coding skills and knowledge to potential future employers. The portfolio is built using React and the React library "Grommet" and contains: an 'About me', a section showing my works that link to the repo and/or deployed app, a contact me that I intend to send me an email but currently will not function as the app is not connected to a back-end, and a downloadable link to my resume.
